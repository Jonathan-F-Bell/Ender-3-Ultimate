# Ender-3-Ultimate
A guide for configuring and upgrading the Ender-3, based on my work in Northeastern University's CAMD Makerspaces.

Currently, the only complete guide is the BLTouch install guide, but others will be added later.

## Guides

### BLTouch Install Guide

The install process consists of 4 major guides, which should be done in order and are referenced within each guide.

If in doubt, start with the "BLTouch Install Guide" and complete the other guides when instructed to within that guide.
